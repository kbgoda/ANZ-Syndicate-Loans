### ANZ-Syndicate-Loans ###
This smart contract is a basic implementation of what a Syndicate Loan would function like behind the hood. The Smart Contract lacks a lot of core functionalities, but it should display the basic capabilities of syndicate loans as a Solidity smart contract.
This smart contract is created for ANZ's Digital Disruption Project, Group Blockchain, University of Sydney Semester 1 2019.

Some ideas and codes come from this article:

The contract can do basic CRUD functions regarding loans and more:
* Create loans
* See loans
* Update loans
* Delete loans
* Add Users to existing loans
* Approve loans

To test this Solidity Smart Contract, deploy on Ganache which is a Ethereum Virtual Machine using Remix online IDE that provides the web3.js for functionality.
