This smart contract is a basic implementation of what a Syndicate Loan would function like behind the hood. The Smart Contract lacks a lot of core functionalities, but it should display the basic capabilities of syndicate loans as a Solidity smart contract.
This smart contract is created for ANZ's Digital Disruption Project, Group Blockchain, University of Sydney Semester 1 2019.

Some ideas and codes come from this article:
* https://medium.com/lition-blog/introducing-the-mvp-of-our-syndicate-loan-dapp-2e50ebb59b1b

### ANZ-Syndicate-Loans ###
The contract can do basic CRUD functions regarding loans and more:
* Create loans
* See loans
* Update loans
* Delete loans
* Add Users to existing loans
* Approve loans

### Testing ###
To test this Solidity Smart Contract: 
* Deploy on Ganache which is a Ethereum Virtual Machine
* This is done using Remix online IDE that provides the web3.js for functionality.
* Another option is to use Truffle+Ganache to deploy and run the smart contract as a Dapp.
